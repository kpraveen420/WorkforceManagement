# WorkforceManagement

• Workforce Management System is a 3-tier (MVC) distributed web application developed to improve the co-ordination, data availability, managing and tracking between Admins, Supervisors, Clients and Security Guards.

• Various modules include Admin, Client, Supervisor, Guard, Buildings, Check-In points, Alerts, Reports, Graphs and Maps.

• Front end was developed with rich UI using Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Angular JS and Google Maps API for better interaction.

• Middleware was developed using Express JS and RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ was used as Message Oriented Middleware which implements Advanced Message Queuing Protocol.

• Back end was developed using Node JS and MySQL. We exposed our web services using REST API's.

• Performance of the application was improved by using Connection Pooling, Redis Caching, SQL Caching, Prepared Statements, Normalization and Denormalization wherever required.

• Security of the application was improved by Salt and Hash (Password encryption), well managed sessions and cookies, avoiding SQL injection attacks, etc.

• Unit test was done using Postman REST client and Load test was done using JMeter.

• Got an appreciation from the professor and grader for developing highly scalable and robust application.
